# About
This project has been created using Django Web Framework. To get TTS feature, Google Cloud TTS API has been used.

# Running the project
##### Step 1:  Create a python virtual environment
Sample command: `python3 -m venv env`

##### Step 2: Activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies
A `requirements.txt` file has been created in the project folder which contains a list of all dependencies required to run the project. 

Sample command to install them (after activating the virtual environment): `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

##### Step 3: Activate the development server
Command: `python3 manage.py runserver`

##### Step 4: Go to `http://localhost:8000`. You will see the homepage upon doing so.
